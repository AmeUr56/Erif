# Erif: AI Model Platform
Erif is a platform that showcases a wide range of AI models, offering insights and tools for various AI branches, including:
- Regression
- Classification
- Computer Vision (CV)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Generative AI (GenAI)
- Time Series
- Reinforcement Learning (RL)
### Features
Erif allows users to explore different AI models across several branches of artificial intelligence. The platform is built using **Flask** and **TensorFlow** to serve AI models, and it supports the following AI capabilities:

- **Regression Models**: Analyze and predict continuous variables using AI.
Classification Models: Build models to categorize data into different classes.
- **Computer Vision**: Utilize AI to interpret and process images and videos.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Analyze and model human language.
Generative AI: Generate new data or content with AI models.
- **Time Series** Forecasting: Model and predict future data points in a time series.
- **Reinforcement Learning(RL)**: Explore models that learn by interacting with their environment.
### Technologies Used
**Flask**: Lightweight web framework for serving AI models.
**Flask-Caching**: Caching mechanism to improve performance and optimize load times.
